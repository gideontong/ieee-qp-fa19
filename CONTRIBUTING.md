### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Outpost Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to gideon@gideontong.com. Thanks!

### Questions and Issues?

Just have a quick question? Don't know how to code but have a feature request? Head over to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gideontong/outpost/issues) and open an issue there if you'd like to suggest a feature or found a bug in our code, but don't know what actually is wrong. Please be as descriptive as possible!

If you have just a quick question but don't want to be bothered by emailing the email address at the top and bottom of the contribution guide (*hint hint*), you can simply file an issue to ask a question. We don't have an official message board to answer questions, but we are working on a FAQ as questions get asked more frequently. Check back at the wiki for future updates!

### Cosmetic Changes
