# Outpost: Documentation

Outpost is a software/hardware toolkit to deploy Internet of Things (IoT) devices at long distances, as well as enable peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity for such devices. It enables data transfer with exposed APIs and provides the necessary tools in order to be usable.

In this folder, you will find `./journal` and `./wiki`, which correspond to each individual part of the documentation. To get started, navigate to [wiki](/wiki) and begin with [README.md](/wiki/README.md) to get started. If you are browsing via the GitHub website, you can also view all of the documentation via the wiki in the GitHub repository.
